Homework using firebase database

Functionality
=============

Train Time allows a user to input a train name, destination, start time, and frequency in minutes.

The information is then stored in firebase and pushed back on the page to also display the train's next arrival time and how many minutes away it is from the user.

Upon loading, refreshing, and entering a train's information, the train time table will update to display the name, destination, frequency, first train time, next arrival, and minutes away for each train stored in firebase.
